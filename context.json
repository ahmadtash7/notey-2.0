He believed that British ideas were far better than anything that came from India and that it would impose Western values and help the British to govern India more effectively. Although a common language would help to unite India, imposing a European culture on the Indians would alienate many of them. Indians had to send their children to co- educational schools, which was unpopular, since it appeared to impose the British system on the Indians without due regard to their religious and cultural feelings. Christian missionaries came to India to convert the local population as well as to set up schools. In these schools the missionar-ies taught Christianity and expected local religions to be given up, which was resented by Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs alike. The replacement of Persian and Sanskrit by English as the official language in the 1830s deeply upset both the Muslims and Hindus. A number of social reforms had been imposed by the British without consultation or care for local feeling, which caused much unrest. The banning of female infanticide and suttee, whilst seen by the British as inappropriate, did go against many traditional feelings Hindus especially held. They were also forced to abandon purdha, which had been an Indian custom for centuries. In 1852, \nthe Doctrine of Lapse was introduced and this caused great unrest because any local kingdom not having a direct male heir was taken over by the British. The introduction of the railway in India revolutionised communication and transformed the country. For Britain, it meant that there was another means of extending their power and helped industry to profit by transporting raw materials to the ports. For the Indians, there were many advantages, especially in times of famine when food could be transported more easily."

He was known as the Tiger of Mysore and ruled there from 1782 to 1799. He won important victories against the British in the Second Anglo-Mysore War, and negotiated the 1784 Treaty of Mangalore with them after his father died the previous year. His treatment of his conquered non-Muslim subjects and British prisoners of war is controversial. He remained an enemy of the British, bringing them into renewed conflict with an attack on Travancore in 1789. In the Third Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu was forced into a humiliating treaty, losing a number of previously conquered territories,including Malabar and Mangalore. In the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War, the combined forces of the British and the Nizam of Hyderabad defeated Tipu and \nhe was killed on 4 May 1799, while defending his fort of Srirangapatna."

The Afghans had been in control of much of the Empire for some time but were unable to make the most of their victory and returned to Kabul.

He introduced a taxon non-Muslims called the Jizya. During Aurangzebs reign, some Hindu temples were destroyed and some limits were placed on Hindu practices. Taxation was high as because of the costs of military campaigns such as the Deccan Wars and building luxurious palaces. Because of these he became an unpopular ruler.Maratha \nguerrilla fighters defeated a Mughal army in 1737 and tookcontrol of Delhi and eastwards towards Bengal.

Thomas Macaulay believed that European ideas of education were vastly superior to anything coming out of India and, as a result, the British imposed a system of education that promoted western values on a people who resented this interference. They were also forced to abandon purdha which had been an Indian custom for centuries. In 1795 the killing of baby daughters was declared to be murder, but the British found difficulty in enforcing this as it was again a tradition practised in many parts of India. Suttee, the ritual burning of Indian women on the funeral pyres of their husbands was also banned by the British, first in Bengal and then in the rest of the country. Although the British had been reluctant to get involved in banning this practice, there was little opposition to the outlawing of it."

Relations between the two remained cordial since self-rule was still their aim and could only be achieved through cooperation. However the Nehru Report ended this hope. It was produced in response to demands for future constitutional reforms and the committee, which drew it up, had minimal Muslim representation. It reported on the future of the sub-Continent by looking to dominion status with no need for separate electorates. This totally alienated the Muslims and marked the end of any future cooperation between them and the Congress. However Jinnah made one final attempt to preserve the relationship in his 14 Points of 1929 in which he proposed three amendments to the report. These proposals were met with refusal and marked what he called the parting of the ways."

These demands were also to form the basis of Muslim Leagues demand for a separate Muslim homeland. It argued that Hindus and Muslims were two separate nations and won much British approval for such a view. However, he also achieved much more. After the 1937 elections, Jinnah set out to reform the Muslim League at grass root level and, as a result, membership had grown significantly by mid-1938. Without this growth, the League would have struggled to be recognised by the British as a powerful player in Indian politics, and hence the fortunes of the Pakistan Movement would have possibly failed to bear fruit when it did. Jinnah used the Lahore Conference in 1940 to ensure that the Muslim League would only accept a solution to the sub-continent which ensured partition. This was called the Pakistan Resolution. He also opposed the proposals of the Cripps Mission that saw Dominion status for the sub-continent. In doing so he helped ensure the British realised the need to protect Muslim interests. Although the Gandhi-Jinnah Talks of 1944 broke up without agreement, Congress was left in no doubt that the League was an important organisation that spoke with authority on behalf of many sub-Continent Muslims. Due to continued pressure from the League and Jinnah, the 3 June Plan of 1947 announced that separate states would be set up  India andPakistan."

As a result of his Allahabad address in 1930 when he put forward this view, separatism was seriously considered by many Muslims during the 1930s. He was also opposed to the British control of India  conquest of others was wrong and went against: the Muslim faith. This strengthened his view that Muslims should have a separate homeland, independent of the British. He persuaded many Muslims that the Muslim League had to build an effective mass political party to challenge the domination of the Congress. This argument was adopted by Jinnah who went on to lead the Muslim League as a highly effective political party. His poetry awakened a sense of nationhood among Muslims and he urged them to be active in making progress. This progress needed to be along a distinctive Islamic path and not capitalist in nature. Again this vision was adopted by Muslims as a view of the future. Rehmat AliIn 1933 he and some fellow students produced a pamphlet called Now or Never in which he argued in favour of partition and gave the name Pakistan to this new Muslim state that would be formed. This became popular amongst most Muslims during the 1930s. His views were different from AI as he wanted a separate independent state whereas AI wanted just a separate state. However, Ali did attract his critics, especially as he criticised many Muslim leaders especially Jinnah and as such was viewed as less important a figure. He attacked him over abandoning Muslim communities in such places as Delhi as well as accepting a divided Bengal. He was also considered less important than Iqbal since Jinnah took up many of his ideas whereas he refused to meet Ali, but nevertheless his views were adopted eventually."

Little money remains for non-staff costs to spend on the primary sector.

This was then followed by the drafting of a constitution, which attracted much criticism as it was seen by many as being insufficiently Islamic. He also managed to keep the economy going and produced surplus budgets for the new state. Malik Ghulam Muhammad as Governor General was responsible for the 6 Year Plan for Pakistan that covered agriculture, power, industry and transport. It played an important part in bringing about economic development in Pakistan. However there were severe problems in Pakistan that hampered development at this time such as food shortages and a drought. Rioting followed and the government found difficulty in dealing with these matters and resulted in many changes in personnel. Little constitutional development could take place because of these problems. Malik Ghulam Muhammad resigned in 1955 due to ill health. Iskander \nMirza became Governor General and introduced the new Constitution in 1956, under which he was able to become President.

Finally the government refused to carry out the Supreme Courts decision to dismiss 20 judges appointed by the governmentwhich caused a political crisis. The dismissal of the Chief Minister in the Punjab after he had upset the PPP also attracted much criticism of Bhuttos handling of the matter."

Its membership of CENTO was treated enthusiastically because many of its fellow members were Muslim countries.

Purdah / suttee were also religious reasons.In 1852 the Doctrine of Lapse was introduced and caused great unrest because any local kingdom not having a direct male heir had their lands taken over by the British.Christianity was taught in missionary schools.Missionaries came to covert people to Christianity and give up local religions.English replaced Sanskrit and Persian as the official language in the 1830s .The greased cartridge incident .Suttee / purdah was abolished  .Indian children educated in co-educational schools .Introduction of the Doctrine of Lapse"

He knew that his bargaining position would be much weaker if he went along with Gandhis plan.The Lahore Resolution, 1940 drafted by the 25-man All-India Muslim League asked for greater Muslim autonomy within India; this was seen as a demand for a separate Muslim state. From then on, the aims of the Muslim League were clear: an independent nation state.The results of the 1945-46 elections demonstrated that Congress had control of the non-Muslim votes but that the League had gained control of the Muslim vote. The Muslim League was now an equal player to Congress so the demand for Partition could no longer be ignored by Congress or the British government.In March 1946, members of the British Cabinet Mission arrived in India to work out a plan for achieving independence for India as a federation which the Muslim League accepted but Congress refused to accept the province groupings and stated that they would not be bound by any British plan. The British government decided to form an interim government headed by Nehru joined by members of the Muslim League.As the Muslim League were concerned that the British would leave India without organising a settlement and that Congress would be left to organise a new country, they organised a Direct Action Day in the summer of 1946 with the aim of stopping the British government giving in to Congress. The disruption worried the British, so gradually they shifted their position on Partition.Gandhi and Jinnah held talks about the future of India but could not agree.The Lahore Resolution 1940.The Cripps Mission led to the Quit India Movement.The Simla Conference 1945.The emergence of the Muslim league as an equal player to Congress following the 1945-46 elections.The British Cabinet Commission and the federal plan for an independent India.Congress rejects the plan.Direct Action Day in 1946 organised by the Muslim League.3 June Plan of 1947 following unrest in the Punjab"

However, this made the objectives of the Movement less clear since it was felt that Hindu groups and Gandhi were using it to advance their own interests, not those of the Muslim community.The Chauri Chaura incident of violence between protesters and the police led Gandhi to withdraw his support from the Khilafat Movement.
